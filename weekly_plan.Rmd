This will serve as a rough guide for the course schedule.  I reserve right to change things as required.

### Part 1: R & RStudio

**Week 1 - Preliminaries**

We'll do the usual first class housekeeping including walking though the syllabus.  We'll also make sure that everyone has R & R Studio installed.  After that, we'll start discussing material material: files, directories, paths, touch-typing, keyboard shortcuts, vectors, dataframes, reading in data from a CSV, dataframe slicing.  We'll end the class by introducing options contracts.

*Assignment:* (Note: nothing to turn in)

- Read Chapter 5 ("Data Transformation"") of *R For Data Science* - **you should type out all the examples along with him**.

- Open a GitHub account.

- Complete the Software Carpentry Lesson on Git and GitHub:
http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/

- Google around and find a short introduction to options.  Read it.  We will amass a list of the good ones in class and I will post them in the Self-Study section of the course website.

&nbsp;

**Week 2 - Data Manipulation (1 of 2)** 

This week will be focused on gaining proficiency the data manipulation functions of the tidyverse `dplyr` package.  Towards this end we will perform an analysis on volume data published by the OCC.  The `dplyr` functions that we cover are: `filter()`, `arrange()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `groupby()`, `summarize()`.  We learn how to create elegant sequences of dplyr functions using the pipe operator.  To end the class we will continue our discussion of options.

<!-- A brief history of R and why itâ€™s used in data science.  Introduction to R: data types and syntax.  Various ways to run R code: interactive command line, scripts, notebooks.   Reading in data from external data sources. Basics of options. -->

<!-- IDEA: a simple visualization of the difference between calendar days and business days. I won't have them graph made up data, but this will be a nice opportunity for them to tell a little story with data and a visualization. -->

*Assignment:* (Note: nothing to turn in)

- Read chapters 19 ("Functions"), 20 ("Vectors""), and 21 ("Iteration") of *R For Data Science* - **Type out all the examples and also work through the exercise.  If you get stuck on any of the problems, just move on after a reasonable amount of effort**.

- Read the *Options Pricing* series of articles on Investopedia - https://www.investopedia.com/university/options-pricing/.  Or find something on your own and share with the class.

- Read Sections 1 - 3.4 of the the wikipedia article on Greeks: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance) . Don't read past section 3.4 (Theta).  None of the other greeks matter.

- Complete the exercises for the *Options Intro* data set in the Data section of the website.


&nbsp;


**Week 3 - Data Manipulation (2 of 2)** 

This week we started by going over the Options Part 3 Slides, the discussion took longer that I anticipated but there was a lot of interest from the students in digging deeper into the finance material.  We ended the class by going over the dplyr tutorial again from start to finish, but only focusing on the essentials.  

*Assignment:* 

- Read and work through Chapter 3 ("Data Visualization"") and Chapter 18 ("Pipes"") of *R for Data Science*.  Note: the chapter numbers I give are from the online version of the book, they may be different for print versions. 


- Work through Part 1 ("A Quick Refresher"") of the DataCamp tutorial on writing functions in R - https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r.   The first section of the tutorial is free, but you have to pay to get access to the rest of the material.  Paying for the rest of the material is not required, but this will be a good introduction to a reputatable online data science education platform.


- Read and work through the "Data Structures", "Subsetting", and "Functions" chapters of *Advanced R* (all three can be can be found under the **Foundations** section).  As the title suggests, this book is more advanced so if you feel overwhelmed don't worry.  If you feel totally lost, you can simply focus on other material.  But as I always say, if you can type along with the examples and generate the same results with some understanding of what is going on, you are making progress. 


- Complete the exercises for the *OCC Volume Report* data set.


&nbsp;



**Week 4 - R Markdown**   

First I'd like to get a sense of how the reading assignments and programming exercises are going for the students.  Then we'll introduce the concept of R Markdown, which is the backbone of R's extensive authoring capabilities. To end the class we'll explore the *Options History Practice* within an `.Rmd` notebook.  

*Assignment:* 

- Read and workthrough the **Communicate** section of R4DS.  In the online verison of the book this is Chapters 26-30, they are about various aspects of R Markdown.

- Complete all exercises for **Option History Practice** data set.

&nbsp;


**Week 5 - Functions and Iteration**   

You now have a bit of experience with writing scripts.  The next level of sophistication is writing functions. We will write a variety of example functions related to data: cleaning a dataframe, an option payoff function.  We will also talk about iterating with for-loops and also iterating with the tidyverse **purrr** package.




**Week 6 - DataViz 1 & Project Assignment** 

Data Visualization with ggplot2().  An introduction to some of the most popular finance related packages on CRAN.  Discuss how to explore packages on your own and other self-study resources.

<!-- Some statics such as linear regression and PCA.  -->

&nbsp;

**Week 7 - DataViz 2 **

More data visualization and the R data analysis project with be assigned.


&nbsp;

**Week 8 - Project Presentations**

We will the group projects.  If there is time remaining we will start with Python.
