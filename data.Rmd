This page will contain that data that we use for in-class examples.

Along with the data, I will post exercises for you to complete as a way to practice programming and explore the data.  I won't necessarily go over all of techniques required, so if you don't understand something you may have to use Google. 

Google is your friend.

### Options Intro

[Options Intro](data_options_intro.csv) - this is a small sample of the Delta Neutral historical options data.  It is end-of-day prices of all the out-of-the-money options for several liquid index ETFs, for one particular expiration, on one particular trading day.

**Exercises:**

1. Read in this data set using `readr::read_csv()`.  Load it into a dataframe called `df_options_intro`.

1. Prove to yourself that this code will work weather you use `readr::read_csv()` or simply `read_csv()`.  Why might you want to use one versus the other?

1. Use `$` notation to grab the `strike` column and print it to the console.  Do the same for `implied_vol` as well as `ask_price`.

1. Use `nrow()` to determine how many rows are in `df_options_intro`.

1. Take a look at `df_options_intro` using `View()`.  Confirm that `nrow()` produced the correct value.  

1. What is the expiration date of all the options?  Which date are these prices from?

1. Use `dplyr::distinct()` to determine how many different underlyings are represented in the data.  What are they?

1. Use `dplyr::filter()` along with variable assignment `<-` to create four sub-dataframes, each of which consists of all of the options for one underlying.  Call these dataframes `df_SPY`, `df_QQQ`, `df_IWM`, `df_DIA`.  (For each iteration, type out the code from scratch. This will be good typing practice that will make you more efficient in the future.)

1. For each of the underlyings, use `ggplot2::qplot()` to create a line graph with `strike` on the x-axis and `implied_vol` on the y-axis.

1. What is the relationship between `strike` and `implied_vol` for these underlyings?

1. Let's break down `df_SPY` a little further.  Using `dplyr::filter()` create two sub-dataframes, one consisting of all the puts and one consisting of all the calls.  Label them `df_SPY_puts` and `df_SPY_calls`, respectively.

1. How many puts are there? How many calls are there?  What are there so many more puts? (Hint: remember that options are insurance contracts and that SPY is an ETF that tracks the S&P 500.)

1. For both `df_SPY_calls` and `df_SPY_puts` create a graph with `strike` on x-axis and `bid_price`.  

1. Based on the graphs you created above: for puts, what is the relationship between strike and price, assuming we hold the price of the underlying fixed?  How about for calls?
