### Course Overview
The purpose of this course is to introduce the R and Python programming languages as computing tools for data science. The first half of the course will focus on R, the second half will focus on Python.  This class is for the Master of Financial Mathematics program, therefore all in-class examples and homework assignments will involve financial data.

I will teach the course assuming that that students have no programming background. However, this course is not intended to be a proper introduction to programming.  Rather, I will introduce programming topics as they are needed to perform analysis.

I have designed the course so that students with strong programming skills will also find the material valuable.  Those who need to spend less time working on the foundational programming skills can spend more time digging into the rich financial data sets that we will have at our disposal.

&nbsp;

### Materials
Students are expected to have a computer capable of running the latest versions of R, R Studio, and the Anaconda distribution.  All this software is free.  I will assign a variety of reading throughout the semester - all of it will be freely available online. 

Here are some of the online resources we will use:

*R for Data Science* - Hadley Wickham

*Advanced R* - Hadley Wickham

*Purrr Tutorial* - Jenny Bryan

### Homework
This is a pass/fail course, so I am going to assign homeworks largely for your benefit.  The homework serves two purposes: practice and feedback.  

For any course, but especially a pass/fail course, the homework is a product that you are paying for, and the grading is a service that you are paying for.  I'm going to keep my end of the bargain, but you have to keep your end.  In that vein, late homework assignments will not be accepted.


Homework will be turned in through Github.  This is for convenience, and is also a way to force you to learn about version control.

&nbsp;

### Projects
There will be two analysis projects.  One at the end of the R section and one at the end of the Python section.  This the first offering of the course, so I need to see how student do over the next couple of weeks to get a sense for the scope of the projects.  I intend to be flexible with this, and I would like you to be able to work on a project that is of interest to you.

Wolverine trading has provided some analysis problems, so student are welcome to work on those, or something else of their own choosing.


&nbsp;

### Grading
This is an elective pass/fail course.  

The determination of pass/fail will be largely based on the two analysis projects.

Homeworks will be grade to provide feeback to the students.
