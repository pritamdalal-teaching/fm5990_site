### Course Overview
The purpose of this course is to introduce the R programming language as a computing tool for data science. This is a class for the Master of Financial Mathematics program; therefore, all in-class examples and homework assignments will involve financial data.

I will teach the course assuming that that students have no programming background. However, this course is not intended to be a proper introduction to programming.  Instread, I will introduce programming topics as they are needed to perform analysis.

Students with strong programming backgrounds will also find this coure valuable.  They can spend less time working on the foundational programming skills, and more time digging into the rich financial data sets that we will have at our disposal.

&nbsp;

### Materials
Students are expected to have a computer capable of running the latest versions of R and R Studio.  All this software is free.  I will assign a variety of reading throughout the semester - all of it will be freely available online. 

Here are some of the online resources we will use:

*R for Data Science* - Hadley Wickham

*Advanced R* - Hadley Wickham

*Purrr Tutorial* - Jenny Bryan

&nbsp;

### Homework
This is a pass/fail course and I assign homeworks soley for your benefit.  The homework serves two purposes: practice and feedback.  

For any course, but especially a pass/fail course, the homework is a product that you are paying for, and the grading is a service that you are paying for.  I will provide you with various exercises and assignments, and you can choose to turn it in for feedback from the TA.  Please coordinate with the TA directly for this.


Homework will be turned in through Github.  This is for convenience, and is also a way to force you to learn about the Git version control system.

&nbsp;

### Projects
There will be one options related analysis project towards the end of the semester.  Most students will be assigned the same basic project, and they are free to elaborate on it to whatever extent that they like.  I intend to be flexible with this, and I would like you to be able to work on a project that is of interest to you.


&nbsp;

### Grading
This is an elective pass/fail course.  

The determination of pass/fail will be largely based on the analysis project.

Homeworks will be graded at the request of studentds in order to provide them feedback on how they are learning.
