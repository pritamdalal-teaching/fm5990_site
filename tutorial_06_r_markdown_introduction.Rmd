This tutorial is a very brief introduction to R Markdown.  Appropriately, it has been created in an R Markdown (`.Rmd`) document which you can download from the *Tutorials* section of the course website.

#### Motivation

In the course of doing data analysis, you will almost always have to communicate various aspects of your analysis to other people.  This communication can take various forms:

1. A slick high-level report to top executives.

1. Sharing the details of your analysis code and dataset with the rest of your quant team.

1. Creating an interactive online dashboard to present to data to the larger world.  

Since the focus of R is data analysis, it has tools that can help with all of these forms of communication.

#### Plain Text vs Formatted Text

Let's first distinguish between plain text and formatted text.  When you create a `.txt` file, you create a file that contain only letters, numbers, and symbols.  Alternatively, when you create a `.docx` file you not only have text, but you have lots of additional information in related to formatting.


As a rule of thumb, whenever you are seeing or working with a formatted text file, there are actually one or more plain text files lurking in the background.

#### WYSIWYG vs Markup

In practice, most people interact with formatted text more than plain text.  Websites, magazines, books, Word documents, Powerpoint presentations, are all highlgy formatted in order to catch our attention.  Our brains need the additional stimulation in order to stay engaged.

In general, there are two ways to interact with digital formatted text documents.  WYSIWYG and Markup.


**WYSIWIG** (What You See Is What You Get) - in this kind of format, the users experience is that they are working directly with the final product.  Word Documents and Powerpoint presentation are good example of WYSIWYG.  These types of formats are easier to learn and are more intuitive.  But they tend to become cumbersome for larger projects or situations where you need more control.

**Markup** - in a markup framework the user is actually interacting with text files, and then there is some kind of interpreter that converts it into a formatted text format, like a PDF or HTML.  LateX is a great example of a markup framework.


In a WYSIWIG setting you are working on a file that looks similar to your final product.  In a markup framework you are working with text files that look like they have computer code in them, and you intermittently *interpret* the text files and have a look at the current state of your final product.

&nbsp;

#### R Markdown

R Markdown is a simple markup framework the facilitates a variety of content creation.  The user edits various plain text files that end in `.Rmd` and then then various R packages are used to interpret the text files and outputs a variety of formatted text formats: PDF, HTML, etc.

The real power of R Markdown is the ability to conveniently combine formatted text, computer code and its output, data visualization (special case of code output), and mathetmatical notation.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

#### Working With Code Chunks

Go to the course website and download the datasets called *Practice Market History* and *Practice Option History*.  Place them in the working directory of the R session that contains this R Markdown document.

Recall that in a script, i.e. a `.R` file, that every line that you write is a line of code, unless it is commented out with a `#`.  With a markdown file, the default assumption for any give line is that it should be interpreted as formatted text.  

Code, on the other hand, is writtend in *chunks*, which need to be demarcated with three tick marks  at the start and the start and stop of the chunk.


Code chunks work very similarly to lines of code in a `.R` script file.  You can load libraries, and then they are loaded in your current R session.  You can create variables and assign them values, and once you do so they are in your environment.  

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
df_option_history <- read_csv("data_practice_option_history.csv")
df_market_history <- read_csv("data_practice_market_history.csv")
```
